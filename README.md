# PCIDSS-GAP-ASSESSMENT-TOOL

## Overview
I created a PCI DSS Compliance Gap Assessment Tool in Excel to streamline and support comprehensive compliance audits. This tool assists organizations in evaluating their conformity with PCI DSS v4.0.1 requirements, identifying gaps, and documenting actionable steps toward compliance.

## Objective
The goal of this tool is to provide a structured and detailed checklist that aligns with the twelve primary PCI DSS requirements, enabling auditors to assess and document each control effectively. By integrating dropdown selections, conditional formatting, and status controls, this tool enhances audit efficiency, accountability, and clarity for both the auditors and the organization.

## Design and Features
- **Requirement Breakdown**: Each of the 12 PCI DSS requirements and Appendix A, additional PCI DSS requirements are listed with descriptive columns, ensuring auditors understand each control.
- **Detailed Sections and Descriptions**: Sub-requirements, including sections like 1.1, 1.2, etc., are broken down with clear explanations of their purpose.
- **Gap Analysis and Findings**: A dedicated section captures findings for each control, allowing auditors to record observations and specific areas where the organization is not conforming.
- **Conformity Status**: An interactive dropdown for each control lets auditors mark the status as Conforming or Non-Conforming. A color-coded system visually highlights areas needing attention.
- **Recommendations and Resources Needed**: This section offers tailored recommendations for achieving compliance and lists required resources, supporting organizations in addressing identified gaps.
- **Task Assignment and Tracking**: Assign each recommendation to a responsible team member, include timelines, and track the status of compliance actions with options like Not Started, In Progress, and Complete.

**_Security and Control Features To ensure data integrity_**:
- The **Status** column is restricted to authorized personnel, using password-protected access, to prevent unauthorized completion sign-offs.
- Only reviewers can approve changes to the Status column, adding a layer of accountability and preventing unauthorized updates.
